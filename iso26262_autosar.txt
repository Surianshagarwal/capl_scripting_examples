7. Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs): 
Introduction of ASILs, a risk classification system, ranging from A (lowest) to D (highest), based on the severity, exposure, and controllability of potential hazards.
Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) are a cornerstone of ISO 26262, providing a framework for classifying and managing the risk of potential hazards in
automotive systems, particularly in Electronic Control Units (ECUs). ASILs range from A (lowest) to D (highest), based on the severity, exposure, and controllability
of hazards. Here's how different types of ECUs can be categorized across these levels:
	ASIL A (Lowest Level)
	Example ECU: Infotainment System ECU
	Reasoning: While a malfunction in the infotainment system can be distracting and may slightly increase the risk of an accident, it typically has a lower impact 
	on the vehicle's fundamental safety functions. The severity of potential harm is relatively low, and drivers usually have a higher ability to control or mitigate 
	the consequences.
	ASIL B
	Example ECU: Automatic Climate Control ECU
	Reasoning: A failure in this system could lead to driver discomfort, potentially increasing stress or distraction. However, the risk of direct harm to the 
	vehicle's operation is moderate. The system is more critical than infotainment but less critical than core driving functions.
	ASIL C
	Example ECU: Cruise Control ECU
	Reasoning: Malfunctions in cruise control can lead to unintended acceleration or deceleration, presenting significant risks. However, in most cases, 
	the driver has the ability to override the system, somewhat mitigating the severity of potential harm.
	ASIL D (Highest Level)
	Example ECU: Brake System Control ECU (like ABS or EBD)
	Reasoning: The braking system is critical for vehicle safety. Any malfunction can directly lead to a loss of vehicle control, potentially resulting in 
	severe injuries or fatalities. The severity of harm is high, and in many scenarios, the driver has limited ability to control or mitigate the risk, especially 
	in high-speed or emergency situations.
	Real-life Considerations
	Severity of Impact: ECUs controlling systems directly related to vehicle control and accident prevention (like steering, braking) usually fall into higher ASIL 
	categories.
	Driverâ€™s Ability to Control or Mitigate Risk: Systems where the driver has less ability to intervene or control the situation in case of a failure are generally
	assigned a higher ASIL.
	Exposure Frequency: Systems that are used more frequently or in a broader range of operating conditions may have a higher ASIL due to increased exposure to risk.
	In summary, ASILs in ISO 26262 guide the automotive industry in prioritizing and addressing the safety of various systems in vehicles, particularly ECUs. 
	The classification into ASIL A to D helps manufacturers to allocate resources effectively and implement appropriate safety measures, ensuring that higher-risk areas 
	receive the most stringent safety considerations.
