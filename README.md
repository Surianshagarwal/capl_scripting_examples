CAPL Programming Examples
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Collection of CAPL examples for automotive network development and testing. 
CAPL is a scripting language used in combination with Vector's CANoe and CANalyzer tools to simulate, test, and validate the behavior of individual ECUs (Electronic Control Units)
and entire CAN networks.

Overview
The examples provided a range of fundamental use cases, from sending and receiving CAN messages to simulating ECU behaviors and automating test cases. 
They serve as a starting point for those looking to get acquainted with CAPL.
